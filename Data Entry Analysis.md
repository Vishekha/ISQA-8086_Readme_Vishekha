### Issues Identified with the Current Data

1. The very first issue with the data provided in all the three spreadsheet is that- there is no column capturing data related to *time*. As per the background description *'aquatic scientists collect plankton samples during both day (e.g. noon) and night (e.g. 2 am) because plankton change their distributions from day to night, and not all species alter their distributions in the same way'* and therefore time related data is required into the spreadsheets.

2. The unit for temperature is missing from all the three spreadsheets. Different individuals working on the data set could consider different units for the temperature like Kelvin, Celsius or Fahrenheit.

3. Looking at all the three spreadsheets, there are many missing rows with no data values. This leads to incomplete data which is required to be fixed.

4. Some columns in the all the three spreadsheet contains decimal values. The number of digits after the decimal shall be same to make the data look organized and neat

5. The plots in the file 2 and file 3 gives no information regarding the X axis and Y axis. The plots are missing some of the required information.

6. Some of the data values are highlighted as after thoroughly going through the data set no inference could be drawn. 

7. In file 3 spreadsheet, it is mentioned that, *'max depth is 72m'*. However, the max depth as per the data values under the depth column is 50, considering data in all the three files. Whether this 72m max depth was set by any individual or it is one of the reading, this requires some additional information for clarification.

8. In file 3,it is mentioned that, *'Max Secchi 14m'*. It is difficult to understand the reason behind this piece of information.

9. in file 3, page 2, immediately after table there is data 7th and 9th, which is difficult to understand the relevance of those two values with the available data set.

10. Column names are changing and also different in all the three files.


### Suggestion for the New System

1. Time column with data entered in 24hours format is required to get the details what time the data was recorded that is during noon or night time. As per the background description plankton changes their distribution from day to nigh. Time data in 24 hours could be helpful in drawing some useful inferences.

2. There should be meta data provided for the data so recorded into the tables presented in the spreadsheet. Different individuals have different ways of persuading information. Therefore, meta data is required for the data so captured and entered into the tables. 

3. Units for each of the column is needed, which can be provided in the meta data but if its mentioned in the column along with column name could be helpful for the user reading the data set. In this case unit for temperature should have been specified.

4. Anything which is highlighted in a table containing multiple records surely catches attention of a reader. Therefore, any data should be highlighted if it really needs to be highlighted and when looked in by others should also make them understand why it was highlighted.

5. The plots should represent information regarding X axis and Y axis. As, other individuals should know what value is plotted against other value. A plot should have all the necessary information.

6. A more organized data with empty cells having value as *Not Available or NULL* rather than just empty.
