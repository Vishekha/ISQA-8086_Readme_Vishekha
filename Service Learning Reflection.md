# SERVICE LEARNING REFLECTION
* The following is to express the learnings I made in this course and illustrating the wonderful experience I had enrolling ISQA 8086-001 Special Topics in ISA from Data to Decisions!

### 1. What is the most important thing I learned in this course? What surprised me the most?
* The most interesting thing I learnt in this project is dealing with real time. The dataset was huge and complex. The meta description was incomplete that made it difficult to understand few variables. However, deciding the analysis approach relative to research question we decided as a team was also another interesting thing. We were at a liberty to choose our own Research Questions and Analysis Approach, this made us dig deep into the data set and attempted multiple hit and trial methods to check what approach will fit in the most. Working with real time data always gives enough experience and I had a good learning working on all the assignments for this class. 
### 2. How well did your initial expectations compare to the actual experience?
*Initially, I was very worried because the data set was huge with multiple fields empty. We got even more worried when we asked our stakeholder to provide us with more dataset if he has any. He gave us 10 more datasets which made our problem worse. But after the lecture which was regarding data cleaning task and after doing data cleaning task by myself I found the work interesting and worth to do. That’s when my brain started working and I could think of different approach for the analysis part.
*To conclude, I would say I started on a scary note but with time that fear was gone and was happy completing all my deliverables on time and as expected.
### 3. What I would like to keep or change if this project is repeated in the future -- any ideas for improvements?
* There is nothing I can think of changing or adding to the structure of the project the way it set now. Working in a team and with a team on real time data is one of the best learning one can get from. Also, we all have been given a fair chance to choose our project and work upon the deliverable one by one.
The entire syllabus and structure of the project is very apt, and I had a very good experience enrolling this course. The hands-on experience in class for R scripts was the cheery on the cake, as I never had chance in other related subjects to practice R code that patiently like I did in this course.
Thank you, Professor, for all the efforts you have made to set the best syllabus for the course and for all the learnings. All this will definitely help me the most with my future work endeavors.

## Peer Review for Team Member
* I was part of Data Wizard Team and it has been a roller coaster ride for me working with the team. Indeed, this roller coaster ride was challenging and ended in a good note with all the deliverables finished on time as planned and expected. The following is the feedback I would like to share regrading individual team members and the amount of work and efforts each has contributed for the Team project work: -

* Vincent - A+
> He made sincere efforts to the project work. Initially, he was very adamant about things and posed problems for members by taking updates twice or thrice a day even when the deliverable date was not near. He never submitted his part on time and used to wait when others submit their part so that he can take inputs from our work.
But we did sort the issues we had mid-way and things went smooth after that.

* Malik - B+
>He made very less contribution to the project work. He could not participate in R script task due to some reason but should have participated in R plots and other tasks. He did not care for any team project’s deliverable. For the final Git package the only thing we asked him to do is to create Project Summary Report, but he could not deliver that too. He never asked us for help and said he is well on track with the Report work. On the day of submission, he turned in incomplete report and said this is the best he could do.
Last moment in about half an hour Vincent and I had to create the Summary Report again.

* Nishi - A+
> She made sincere efforts to the project work, did her work on time.
