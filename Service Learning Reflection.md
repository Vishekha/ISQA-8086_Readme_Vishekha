## Peer Review for Team Members
* I was part of Data Wizard Team and it has been a roller coaster ride for me working with the team. Indeed, this roller coaster ride was challenging and ended in a good note with all the deliverables finished on time as planned and expected. The following is the feedback I would like to share regrading individual team members and the amount of work and efforts each has contributed for the Team project work: -

* Vincent - A+
> He made sincere efforts to the project work. Initially, he was very adamant about things and posed problems for members by taking updates twice or thrice a day even when the deliverable date was not near. He never submitted his part on time and used to wait when others submit their part so that he can take inputs from our work.
But we did sort the issues we had mid-way and things went smooth after that.

* Malik - B+
>He made very less contribution to the project work. He could not participate in R script task due to some reason but should have participated in R plots and other tasks. He did not care for any team projectâ€™s deliverable. For the final Git package the only thing we asked him to do is to create Project Summary Report, but he could not deliver that too. He never asked us for help and said he is well on track with the Report work. On the day of submission, he turned in incomplete report and said this is the best he could do.
Last moment in about half an hour Vincent and I had to create the Summary Report again.

* Nishi - A+
> She made sincere efforts to the project work, did her work on time.
